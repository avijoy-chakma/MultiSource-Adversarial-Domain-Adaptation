# MultiSource-Adversarial-Domain-Adaptation
Human   activity   recognition   (HAR)   fromwearable  sensors  data  has  become  ubiquitous  due  to  thewidespread   proliferation   of   IoT   and   wearable   devices.However,   recognizing   human   activity   in   heterogeneousenvironments, for example, with sensors of different modelsand  make,  across  different  persons  and  their  on-bodysensor  placements  introduces  wide  range  discrepancies  inthe data distributions, and therefore, leads to an increasederror  margin.  Transductive  transfer  learning  techniquessuch  as  domain  adaptation  have  been  quite  successful  inmitigating  the  domain  discrepancies  between  the  sourceand  target  domain  distributions  without  the  costly  targetdomain  data  annotations.  However,  little  exploration  hasbeen   done   when   multiple   distinct   source   domains   arepresent,  and  the  optimum  mapping  to  the  target  domainfrom  each  source  is  not  apparent.  In  this  paper,  we  pro-pose a deep Multi-Source Adversarial Domain Adaptation(MSADA)  framework  that  opportunistically  helps  selectthe  most  relevant  feature  representations  from  multiplesource domains and establish such mappings to the targetdomain  by  learning  theperplexity  scores.  We  showcasethat  the  learned  mappings  can  actually  reflect  our  priorknowledge   on   the   semantic   relationships   between   thedomains,  indicating  thatMSADAcan  be  employed  as  apowerful  tool  for  exploratory  activity  data  analysis.  Weempirically  demonstrate  that  our  proposed  multi-sourcedomain  adaptation  approach  achieves  2%  improvementwith OPPORTUNITY dataset (cross-person heterogeneity,4  ADLs),  whereas  13%  improvement  on  DSADS  dataset(cross-position  heterogeneity,  10  ADLs  and  sports  activi-ties).
